# Getting help

Serde is one of the most widely used Rust libraries so any place that Rustaceans
congregate will be able to help you out. For chat, consider trying the
[#general] or [#beginners] channels of the unofficial community Discord, the
[#rust-usage] channel of the official Rust Project Discord, or the
[#general][zulip] stream in Zulip. For asynchronous, consider the [\[rust\] tag
on StackOverflow][stackoverflow], the [/r/rust] subreddit which has a pinned
weekly easy questions post, or the Rust [Discourse forum][discourse].
